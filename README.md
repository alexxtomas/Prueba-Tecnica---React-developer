To start App → 

## To Start App:

## **What would you have done if you had more time?**

I have totally focused on getting the solution to what was requested, due to the short time I have had to implement quick solutions, leaving aside the **scalability** and **performance.**

If I had more time I would migrate everything to **typescript, add testing, and implement more scalable solutions, along with improving the performance of the application.**
